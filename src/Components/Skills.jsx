                      Hello, my name is Thiruveedi Santhosh. I am 19 years old and currently pursuing a degree in Visual Communication at Andhra Loyola College, Vijayawada. From a young age, I have been passionate about creativity and design, which inspired me to build skills in both graphic design and video editing.

Alongside my studies, I have been gaining practical experience as a Graphic and Video Designer at Maranatha Temple, where I create engaging visual content that connects with audiences and enhances communication. This role has helped me develop a strong foundation in design software, video editing tools, and creative storytelling.

I am always eager to learn new techniques and stay updated with the latest trends in the field of media and communication. My goal is to grow as a creative professional, contribute innovative ideas, and build a career where I can combine my skills in visual communication, design, and digital media.

I am from Ganguru, Vijayawada, and I believe my dedication, creativity, and enthusiasm will help me achieve success in the visual communication industry.
