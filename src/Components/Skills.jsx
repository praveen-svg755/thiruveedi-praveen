                   My name is Thiruveedi Praveen, and I am currently pursuing a Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering at PSCMR College, now in my third year.<br/>

I have always been passionate about technology and problem-solving, which motivated me to choose CSE as my specialization. Over the past two years, I have built a strong foundation in programming languages and core computer science concepts.<br/>

I am currently looking for internship opportunities to enhance my skills and gain industry experience. I am from Vijayawada and am excited to contribute to innovative projects while continuing to learn and grow.<br/>
